"""Reference implementation of the fp2 canonicalization spec.

Normative document: docs/fingerprints/fp2.md

This is the reference both SDKs are checked against. It deliberately
FAILS on values it cannot represent rather than coercing them: coercion
is what produces a digest that looks verified but silently depends on an
object's repr.

Two rules exist purely so Python and JavaScript agree byte-for-byte, and
both are easy to get wrong in the obvious way:

* Object keys are ordered by **UTF-16 code unit**, not by code point.
  Python's bare ``sorted()`` compares code points, which inverts against
  JavaScript for any key containing an astral character.
* Numbers are serialized with the **ECMAScript ``Number::toString``**
  algorithm, not with Python's ``repr``. ``repr(1e16)`` is ``'1e+16'``
  where JavaScript emits ``10000000000000000``.

Both rules follow RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme).
